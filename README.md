# traffic-prediction
SHORT-TERM traffic prediction is an important component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The time complexity, quality and reliability of prediction affect the response speed and performance of ITS directly. Real-time and accurate traffic flow prediction models are of great significance for decision-making of both travelers and managers. Due to the influence of weather, events, holidays and other factors, traffic conditions are nonlinear and time-varying, which introduces significant challenges in traffic prediction.
We calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between monitor stations to obtain the initial adjacent matrix and fine-tune it while training. As to the model, we construct a multi-stream feature fusion block (MFFB) module, which includes a three-channel network and the soft attention mechanism.
